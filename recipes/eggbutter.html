        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Egg butter is a Finnish and Estonian cuisine staple, <br />also known as munavoi in Finnish and munavõi in Estonian. <br /> It's essentially a mixture of soft butter and chopped, hard-boiled eggs.</p>
        <p>In Finland, it's traditionally spread on hot Karelian pasties. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>6 drops Worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill <br /> with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. <br/> Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. <br/> Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. <br/> Cool the eggs under cold running water. Peel, and remove yolks from white. <br/> Chop yolks; reserve whites for another use.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Beat butter in a large bowl until soft and fluffy. Mix in the egg yolks, cayenne <br> pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Beat until smooth.</li>
